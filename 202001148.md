problem statement

##Q1 Identify functional and non-functional requirements.

functional requirements :
          - Ability to borrow and return books by members.
          - Ability to extend borrowing date.
          - Easy book transactions management for library staff.
          - Librarian can add or remove records in the system.
          - Online book browsing and searching for non-members.
          - Issuing and returning books restricted to members.
          
non-functional requirements :
          Performance : system should be able to do certain operations within time.
          Scalability : system should be scalable to support large number of users.
          UX/UI : system should be user friendly.
          Secuirity : system should store confidential information (eg., passwords) with some kind of encryption.
          Reliability : updating the database by synchronizing between database and application.
          
          
##Q2 

Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

Features : 
          - system uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events.
          - system stores key sound events to recognize the sound.
          -  system responds Immediately for recognized sound events.
          - used approach is considered on the distension vibration that notifies the user of incoming messages or calls in their mobile.
          - Hearing-impaired might needs an application that  could attract them and one of  the criteria  is animation. It will help the mind to relate graphic and it could enable the curiosity among these slow learners to utilize the application. While usage of text (captioning) on the other hand is important for  creating a  relationship between  the animation  and video would enable the learner to enjoy the learning process and make them engaged towards the application. 

Scope : 
        - This mobile  application basically  assist  hearing-impaired  in many  ways  such  as  for learning, communication, teaching, religious and gaming.
        - The feature of vibration in mobile app  could alert them easily  since the  hearing-impaired could  not hear the  sound that comes  from their mobiles.  The vibration mode was also used in different ways such as lesser, higher and pattern  mode.  This  vibration  mode  is  able  to  be  adjusted according  to the  level of  hearing loss problem  faced by  the user.

Non-functional apects : 
              -  Reliability : system should be reliable and accurate for sound recognization.
              - Affordability : more number of Hearing-impaired people should be able to use the system.
              - Advanced sensors
              - Mobile application developed must be able to ensure prospect of a user, along with the limiation in mobile technology.
